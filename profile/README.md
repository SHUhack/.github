## Sheffield Hallam University Hack Society (SHUhack)

The student-run society focused on ethical hacking, computer security, digital forensics and anything inbetween.

Students at Hallam are welcome to join regardless of degree studied, course year and course type. Feel free to contact the HackSoc Committee for this.

This GitHub organisation hosts open-source projects, information and media relating to us.
